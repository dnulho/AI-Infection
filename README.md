# AI-Infection
The goal of this project is to create a sandbox style game that allows the player to play a virtual intelligence/conceiousness
that can explore, incorporate, and potentially conquer the near infinite resources of a procedurally generated world, both virtual and physical.

# Goals:
 * Procedurally Generated Network of Computers, Routers, and Phones
	- Each object needs its own unique object number (within each gameworld) that can be referenced anywhere, by anybody.
 * Friendly UI
	- As the player advances, the UI upgrades alongside the AI.
 * Maximum Efficency World Storage
	- Binary files stored to disk, with a predetermined number of objects cached in RAM for quick retrival and smooth gameplay.
 * Create a physical world that the network is tied into, and can be interacted with once certain things have been unlocked.
 * Create a modding API that is open and available to anyone. Anyone can develop and publish mods and extensions to the game.
	- Good ideas may be incorperated into the vanilla game.


# Ideas
 * store map in linked lists
 * Display only the currently accessed componant, with a list of all connected componants that can be accessed.
